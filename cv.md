## Summary

I have over 20 years of Java programming and application development experience across various industries, including fintech, telecommunications, and hospitality. I possess practical, hands-on expertise in executing and architecting the modernisation of legacy systems, including migration to cloud-native architectures such as microservices. I have strong DevOps skills ranging from cloud infrastructure deployment automation to CI/CD pipeline configuration, with particular focus on AWS environments. During the initial 10 years of my career, I specialised as a full-stack developer, implementing robust middleware and creating feature-rich UIs. Currently, I'm expanding my expertise by integrating AI and machine learning into my technical toolkit to enhance and optimise the systems I build.
